Here is a quick summary of what I have done:
- ListView with adapter for showing picture and time stamp.
- big blue button to take a selfie (calls camera and returns image)
- images are saved to storage/sd/Pictures/DailySelfie
- images from this folder are loaded on the apps loading.
- A notification will be set each 2 minutes from opening the app
- clicking on this notification will bring you back to the app.
